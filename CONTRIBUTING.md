# Contribution Guidelines

## Code of Conduct 
Please read our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing. 
If you don't agree with it, please don't contribute.

## `master` is production
Our demo site try.orientation.io is deployed when the latested build is green,
therefore anything merged into master should be production-ready as much as possible.

## New Features
Orientation's [existing and planned features](doc/FEATURES.md) are documented. Please 
don't submit pull requests for unplanned features before opening up an [issue](https://github.com/orientation/orientation/issues/new)
to discuss it with the maintainers. We want to keep this project small and focused.

## Specify and Test
Orientation is used by real humans. When it breaks, it wastes their time and causes them 
to lose trust in this software, so please add specs to any new code you contribute. If 
you find untested code and contribute tests for it, you will receive heaps of virtual hugs.
